# UniHub [1] - Project Planning

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

UniHub is a comprehensive university platform designed to connect students, supervisors, and administrators through a centralized hub for events, blogs, opportunities, and gamified engagement. The system provides an intuitive, role-based interface, enabling users to propose and participate in events, publish and review blogs and internship/job opportunities, and track their contributions through points and badges. By integrating real-time updates, analytics dashboards, and responsive design, UniHub facilitates seamless collaboration, engagement, and visibility across multiple university portals and a global network.

The platform is structured around core modules, including Event Management, Blog & Opportunity Management, Gamification, User Management, and System Analytics, all of which interact with a points and badge system. Supervisor and admin roles ensure content quality and moderation, while students enjoy a gamified environment that encourages active participation and contribution.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 What UniHub Does 

The primary objectives of the UniHub system are to:

* **Event Management** – Students can participate in or organize events; supervisors approve events.
* **Blogs & Opportunities** – Students/supervisors can create blogs or post jobs/internships; supervisors approve content.
* **Gamification** – Points and badges reward participation; instant pop-up notifications enhance motivation upon reaching new levels or badges.
    * “Enhance user motivation by providing instant, gamified feedback via pop-up notifications upon badge or level promotions.”
* **Dashboards** – Role-based dashboards for students, supervisors, and admins with analytics, leaderboards, and notifications.
* **Multi-University & Global Portal** – Each university has its own portal; approved content can appear globally.
* **Real-Time Updates** – Dashboards, leaderboards, and notifications update in real time using WebSockets. 

### **2.2 User Roles**

There are **3 primary user roles**:

|Role	|Access / Responsibilities	|
|---	|---	|
|**Student**	|Create events/blogs, join events, view leaderboard, earn points/badges.	|
|---	|---	|
|**Supervisor**	|Approve events/blogs, review reports, moderate content.	|
|**Admin**	|Manage users/universities, view system-wide analytics, oversee global leaderboards.	|

### **2.3 Core Modules & Flow**

1. **Authentication**
    1. Users log in, register, or reset passwords.
    2. Roles determine which dashboard & features are visible.
2. **Home / Landing Page**
    1. Public access: preview events, blogs, and leaderboard sneak peek.
    2. CTAs guide users to register/login.
3. **Event Management Flow**

    4. Users join as Organizer/Volunteer/Attendee.
    5. Points allocated based on role: Organizer = 50, Volunteer = 20, Attendee = 10.
    6. Supervisors/admins can cancel events, notify participants.
4. **Blog & Opportunity Flow**
