General Features
1- first displayed events are the newest
2- If the event is ended (closed/end time) add a tag that this event is done (rephrase it) and show it in bottom of events
3- Event Time filter is not working (not calling the backend websocket mostly)
4- Make the header (NavBar) static on the website
5- Add static up button on down-right (which return user to top of the page)
6- ⭐ Points Configuration (I want to delete this option from the whole app (create event, edit event))
7- Quick Actions (it is not responsive and it covers the content)
8- For Reporting System I want the report to only show on Pending & Active (Approved & Still running) also if the report is resolved or dismissed we want to send notification for the user submitted the report also if the report is solved the user who submitted it get +15 points and if dismissed he got -50 points, other thing user can report an event or blog only one time to avoid overhead
9- Add Jordanian Universities to the drop down list and & filters everywhere it used at (Idk where is better in DB or frontend or backend IDK)
10- Colors and UI style is good but lack of visibility Please configure colors in both mode light/dark also the responsivity of the website is bad please configure it also the spaces
ex1: Admin Dashboard (is not visible within dark mode)
ex2: My Recent Events & Recent Notifications & Top Contributors & My Recent Blogs (is not visible within dark mode specially the header of the cards)
ex3: events & blogs description are not visible in dark mode
ex4: Leaderboard both (Top Members - Global & Top Events - Global) content are not visible in dark mode
ex5: User Management dashboard is not visible in dark mode
ex6: University Management dashboard is not visible in dark mode
11- My Recent Events & Recent Notifications & Top Contributors & My Recent Blogs give them the same size (better size for alignment)
12- Can we enhance analytics page IDK how you figure it out
13- Can we rename Badges with name more interesting (FROM CODE FORCES OR GAMES, ETC..)
14- Can we verify the user can be only organizer or volunteer or attendee and he can only one time request for that in the event (he can resubmit if the owner or Supervisor or Admin reject him) & we want when user request to event as member that a request will be send to the event owner & Supervisor & Admin and anyone can accept or reject (I think this need to be set in the event it self and only visible to event owner & Supervisor & Admin) (if the request is accepted from owner or Supervisor or Admin it should be deleted from all of them) + I think this should be also added to burger menu as event requests (showing there user requests to events & requests to this user events)
